## AI-Powered Pneumonia Detection with Explainable Deep Learning

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** such as ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2 to classify chest X-rays as either "Normal" or "Pneumonia". Alongside, it integrates **Grad-CAM** for visual explanations, helping understand what the model is actually focusing on.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- **Loads a medical image dataset** from Hugging Face (`hf-vision/chest-xray-pneumonia`)
- **Preprocesses data** using PyTorch transforms (including grayscale conversion and normalization)
- **Trains models** with various CNN backbones using transfer learning
- **Evaluates performance** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Generates visual explanations** using Grad-CAM to highlight areas influencing predictions

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install the core dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn datasets grad-cam
```

## ðŸ§ª How It Works (In Brief)

1. **Preprocessing**: Chest X-rays are resized, normalized, and augmented.
2. **Model Architecture**: A pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned for binary classification.
3. **Training Loop**: Models are trained and validated with custom loaders and optional class balancing.
4. **Evaluation**: Includes classification reports and confusion matrices.
5. **Grad-CAM**: Visual heatmaps show which parts of an X-ray contributed most to the prediction.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

You can try out different architectures:
- `resnet18` âœ… (visualized with Grad-CAM)
- `densenet121`
- `mobilenet_v2`
- `efficientnet_b0`
- `vgg16`

The best model is picked based on validation accuracy.
